MakerNexus local modifications
------------------------------

***NOT SETTLED DESIGN YET. WORK IN PROGRESS.***

At [MakerNexus], we're working on making as many face-shields as possible;
They will be in dire demand very soon and we got requests of thousands of them.
MakerNexus is coordinating the contact with the local hospitals and
as well the effort of non-Members of the maker-space to 3D print. We
have enough shield material to laser-cut, but of course 3D printing is the
slow part of manufacturing.

Please check out the [project page] if you are in the San Francisco
Bay Area and want to help.

We are using the [Prusa-rc2] design, but needed some modifications requested
by the local healthcare community.

### Design goals

When reviewing, the local healthcare providers requested

   * Weight-reduce front-part if possible.
   * Move the shield pins up so that there is material behind the openings
     of the shield-punches

Moving up the shield-pin requires a little bit of support material, but it
is not a problem to generate the necessary STL file where the supports should
be and use that in the Prusa slicer as support modifier.

### Code

A simple OpenScad file that take the original STL and does the necessary
surgical changes.

### Slicer project file
A 3mf file is provided, so it can be loaded into slicer right away:

```
git clone https://github.com/hzeller/prusa-covid19-shield-remix.git
cd prusa-covid19-shield-remix
prusa-slicer prusa-covid-shield-remix.3mf
```

### GCode
There is also [gcode directly sliced for Prusa MK3(s)](prusa-covid-shield-remix-print_shield_0.3mm_PETG_MK3S.gcode) that prints two headbands on the
build-plate.

### Development

For building, use the Makefile to create all the artifacts from the *.scad
file

```
make
```
